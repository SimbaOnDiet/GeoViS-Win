# GeoViS-Win

This is my course work for Optics. This project aimed to offer a Windows version for the academic software GeoViS (Müller T. GeoViS—Relativistic ray tracing in four-dimensional spacetimes[J]. Computer Physics Communications, 2014, 185(8): 2301-2308. ) , which is available at  http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AESY_v1_0.html . 



The current Windows version(still in early development stage) did work and succeeded to produce some outcome(whether it is correct or not), also a fatal bug concerning iterator in the original version is fixed. However it is highly unstable and crashes easily. I tried to fixed it but failed to spared more time after the deadline of the summit of course work. Hence, I decided to release the code now, but please notice that the code ready cannot lead us anywhere or do any good to us. The official Linux version is always the choice. If you did have an issue about this poorly developed Windows version, just contact me. 



NOTICE: The paper claimed that GeoViS is released under Standard CPC license, however the code contains a LICENSE statement claim that it is released under GPLv3 license. I will treat the statement comes along with the code the more valid one. Hence this badly coded version is still under GPLv3.
